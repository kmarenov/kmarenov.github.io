I am PHP Developer from Russia.

I am interested in everything related with software development and web development.

I read books and blogs about programming. I have visited developers events such as DevConf (the biggest web developers conference in Russia), YaC (Yandex supported
conference for developers) etc.

I tend to use modern tools and technologies such as PHP 7, Composer, Vagrant, Codeception, PhpStorm, Yii 2 etc.
